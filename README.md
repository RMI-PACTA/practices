# practices

This document intends to document how we develop software at RMI, including
social and technical aspects around a number of themes. It should help guide
our actions,  and understand what to expect from our colleagues and what they
expect from us.  Wherever possible, we refer to the source of information
that defines a "best practice". Anecdotes and personal experience have
value, but we prefer evidence from research, books, and large and mature
communities of practice.

We have agreed to these practices by consensus. They document heuristics, as
detailed instructions may never cover all scenarios. We focus on _what_ to do
and _why_, and only recommend optional resources about _how_ to do it.
We realize there may be times when you can not achieve all of these practices.
In those cases, it's nice to let others know, e.g. in a commit description or a
PR comment, how or why some of these guidelines could not be met.

* [Repository Maintainer Guidelines](maintainer.md)

We also keep public documentation of interesting resources (best practices and otherwise) here:
