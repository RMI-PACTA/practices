# What Does It Mean to be the Maintainer of a Repository?

A network of active maintainers can help lead to a well-functioning software ecosystem. Maintainers are responsible for the health of a repository, which includes its functionality, documentation, and communication. Maintainers are also responsible for the health of the community around the repository, which includes the responsiveness of the maintainers, the clarity of the repositoryâ€™s purpose, and the accessibility of the repository to new users.

Below is the the RMI-PACTA Tech Team's guidance for what it means to be the maintainer of a repository. The guidance is not necessarily exhaustive, but should give an idea of what the expectations are of a maintainer.

## Communication
Maintainers are responsible for clear communication regarding the state of the repository and its intended use, including any expected changes in usage. This includes clear documentation of its interface (see Documentation, below).

## Updates and Fixes
They must update the repository in a timely manner, which involves bug fixes, reviewing issues, and updating GitHub actions.

## Documentation
They must provide good documentation to explain the expected functionality and outputs of the repository.

## Decision Making
Maintainers are the decision-makers for structural changes or contentious features within the repository.

## Awareness of Use and Dependencies
Maintainers should be particularly cautious about changes to repositories that are dependencies of larger workflows to avoid breaking changes.

## Communication of Changes
Any substantial change that may affect other parts of the workflow should be communicated, preferably in a tech review call or similar forum, to discuss the potential impacts and necessary adjustments.

## Practical Implications
Maintainers of a repository will be defined using the `.github/CODEOWNERS` file of that repository. File-specific maintainers can also be defined in this manner. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners) for more info.
