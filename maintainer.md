# What Does It Mean to Maintain a Repository?

A solid ecosystem of maintainers can help lead to a well-functioning software environment. Maintainers are responsible for the health of a repository, which includes its functionality, documentation, and communication. Maintainers are also responsible for the health of the community around the repository, which includes the responsiveness of the maintainers, the clarity of the repositoryâ€™s purpose, and the accessibility of the repository to new users.

Below are some of our heuristics for what it means to be a maintainer of a repository. These are not necessarily exhaustive, but should give an idea of the expectations of a maintainer.

## Communication
Maintainers are responsible for clear communication regarding the state of the repository and its intended use, including any expected changes in usage. When possible, this may include clear documentation of its API.

## Updates and Fixes
They must update and fix the repository in a timely manner, which involves bug fixes, reviewing issues, and updating workflows/actions.

## Documentation
They must provide good documentation to explain the expected functionality and outputs of the repository.

## Decision Making
Maintainers are the decision-makers for structural changes or contentious features within the repository.

## Awareness of Use and Dependencies
Maintainers should be particularly cautious about changes to repositories that are dependencies of larger workflows to avoid breaking changes.

## Communication of Changes
Any substantial change that may affect other parts of the workflow should be communicated, preferably in a tech review call or similar forum, to discuss the potential impacts and necessary adjustments.

## Collaborative Responsibility
Ideally, there will only be one maintainer per repository. In some cases, that maintainer may decide that certain files (for example, the `Dockerfile`) are best maintained by someone else. In that case, a file-specific maintainer may be specified. The lead maintainer should be responsible for ensuring that the co-maintainer is aware of the changes and is able to make them. If more than a handful of files are managed by a co-maintainer, it is a good indication that the repository should be refactored and split into multiple repositories.

## Practical Implications
Maintainers of a repository will be defined using the `.github/CODEOWNERS` file of that repository. File-specific maintainers can also be defined in this manner. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners) for more info.
