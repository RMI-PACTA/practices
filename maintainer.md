# What Does It Mean to Maintain a Repository?

## Communication
Maintainers are responsible for clear communication regarding the state of the repository and its intended use, including any expected changes in usage. When possible, this may include clear documentation of its API.

## Updates and Fixes
They must update and fix the repository in a timely manner, which involves bug fixes, reviewing issues, and updating workflows/ actions.

## Documentation
They must provide good documentation to explain the expected functionality and outputs of the repository.

## Decision Making
Maintainers are the decision-makers for structural changes or contentious features within the repository.

## Collaborative Responsibility
When there are multiple maintainers, the responsibility becomes shared. This may be especially important for larger repositories that are used by many people downstream.

## Awareness of Use and dependencies
Maintainers should be particularly cautious about changes to repositories that are dependencies of larger workflows to avoid breaking changes.

## Communication of Changes
Any substantial change that may affect other parts of the workflow should be communicated, preferably in a tech review call or similar forum, to discuss the potential impacts and necessary adjustments
